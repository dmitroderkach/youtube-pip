and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **PiPManager**: Fixed UX issue when returning from PiP while in mini player mode
  - Previously, the main player would briefly appear before restoring the mini player, causing visual confusion
  - Added conditional check to directly restore mini player without showing main player first
  - Now smoothly returns to mini player state without any intermediate transition

### Changed

- **MiniPlayerController**: Integrated YouTube native actions for mini player control
  - Added `activateMiniPlayer()` method using YouTube's native `yt-activate-miniplayer` action
  - Refactored `toggle()` to `toggleMiniPlayerViaKeyboard()` for clearer distinction between native actions and keyboard simulation
  - Removed unused `show()` and `hide()` methods

- **Logger**: Replaced `dayjs` with native `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API
  - Removed external dependency for timestamp formatting
  - Bundle size reduced by ~26 KB
  - Zero runtime dependencies for date formatting

- **PlayerManager**: Simplified `restorePlayingState()` method
  - No longer needs to be async

### Added

- **YouTubeAppElement**: Added `fire()` method to interface for YouTube native action dispatching

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **MenuObserver**: Re-observe menu button when it is removed from DOM
  - YouTube removes the playlist expand button (not just hides it) when navigating to a video without a playlist
  - When navigating back to a video with a playlist, the button reappears but was no longer observed
  - Added removal detection via `MutationObserver` on `document.body`; when button is disconnected, we disconnect observers, re-wait for the button, and re-observe

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-27

### Changed

- **NavigationHandler**: Removed `history.pushState` when navigating from PiP
  - YouTube does not update the URL in the mini player, so we no longer update it on the main page
  - Only `popstate` event is dispatched to trigger SPA navigation

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **MenuObserver**: Fixed playlist expand button detection when navigating within video playlists
  - The expand button may not appear immediately when opening a regular video in PiP
  - Button can appear later during navigation within a video playlist while PiP is already open
  - Replaced `querySelector` with `waitForElementSelector` to wait indefinitely for the button to appear
  - Automatically aborts if PiP window closes before button appears
  - Initialization runs in background (non-blocking)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Initial release** of YouTube PiP userscript
- **Document Picture-in-Picture** support using Chrome's Document PiP API
- **Media Session integration** for triggering PiP from native media controls
- **SPA navigation** - video links in PiP navigate without page reloads
- **Seek support** - click or drag progress bar in PiP window
- **Like/Dislike buttons** - fully functional in PiP window
- **Context menu** - seamlessly moves between main window and PiP
- **Playlist panel** - automatic window height adjustment when expanded
- **Title synchronization** - window titles stay in sync via Media Session API
- **Playback state preservation** - position and playing state preserved on PiP close
- **Modular TypeScript architecture** with OOP design
- **Scoped logger** with conditional debug mode via `localStorage`
- **Build system** using Vite with inline source maps
- **ESLint and Prettier** for code quality
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD and automated releases
- **Comprehensive documentation** (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG)
